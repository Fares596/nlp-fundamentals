    "## The Forward Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Forward Algorithm relies on the **Markov property**, which states that the next state depends only on the current state, not on the entire past.  \n",
    "This assumption allows us to compute the probability of an observation sequence efficiently through recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $N$ be the number of hidden states  \n",
    "- $A_{ij} = P(s_t = j \\mid s_{t-1} = i)$ : the state transition probabilities  \n",
    "- $B_j(o_t) = P(o_t \\mid s_t = j)$ : the emission probabilities  \n",
    "- $\\pi_i = P(s_1 = i)$ : the initial state distribution  \n",
    "\n",
    "We define the **forward variable** $\\alpha_t(i)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_t(i) = P(o_1, o_2, \\dots, o_t, s_t = i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents the probability of observing the first $t$ observations and being in state $i$ at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization** (for $t = 1$)  \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\alpha_1(i) = \\pi_i \\, B_i(o_1)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursion** (for $t = 2, 3, \\dots, T$)  \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\alpha_t(j) = \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_{t-1}(i) \\, A_{ij} \\right] B_j(o_t)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(O \\mid \\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_T(i)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $O = (o_1, o_2, \\dots, o_T)$ is the sequence of observations,  \n",
    "and $\\lambda = (A, B, \\pi)$ denotes the model parameters.\n"

    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward variable $\\alpha_t(i)$ captures the **total probability of all possible hidden-state paths** that end in state $i$ after observing the first $t$ symbols.  \n",
    "At each step, it accumulates probabilities from all previous states, weighted by the transition probabilities $A_{ij}$ and the emission probability $B_j(o_t)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the Forward Algorithm behaves like a **flow of probability mass** that moves forward through time — each state at time $t$ receives contributions from all states at time $t-1$.  \n",
    "This recursive accumulation makes it possible to compute the likelihood of the entire observation sequence without enumerating every possible state path.\n"
